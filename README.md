# RFM-Analysis
RFM Analysis is a marketing analytics tool used to identify a company’s most valuable customers by examining three specific purchasing behaviours:
1.how recently a customer has made a purchase (Recency),
2.how often they make purchases (Frequency),
3. how much money they spend (Monetary value).

To solve the problem of RFM Analysis using SQL, follow the steps below:

Step 1: We’ll primarily focus on Customer ID, Purchase Date, and Transaction Amount for RFM analysis. Ensure these fields are correctly formatted:
a)Purchase Date should be in a date format,
b)Transaction Amount should be a numeric value.

Step 2: The next step would involve creating a table in your SQL database that matches the structure of your data and then importing the data. This step is highly dependent on the SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and tools you’re using.

Step 3: The next step is to calculate RFM metrics:
a)Recency (R): Calculate how recently each customer made a purchase.
b)Frequency (F): Calculate how often each customer makes a purchase.
c)Monetary (M): Calculate the total money spent by each customer.
